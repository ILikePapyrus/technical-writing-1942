Epic top down 2D shooter game.

Fly in the air while avoiding deadly bullets and projectiles from enemy aircraft.

The player will be a fighter plane moving in 2d space.
The enemies will shoot relatively slow moving (must be dodgeable) projectiles at the player aircraft.
The player has 3 lives. Every time he hits an enemy projectile he will lose one life.
When all lives are lost the game is over and the player must restart.

The player is also able to shoot projectiles, though they are faster moving than the enemy's.
Enemies will die on one hit, aside from bosses which will take multiple hits.

The whole game operates on a 2D plane and there are no gameplay elements outside of it.
